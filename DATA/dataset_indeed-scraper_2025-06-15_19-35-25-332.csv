In order to be successful, you will need to be able to combine business process knowledge with deep technical understanding of systems and software to help identify and implement scalable solutions.

Staff Business Systems Analysts at HubSpot have a few things in common: they have an eye for scale with previous success in implementing scalable products/systems along cross-functional teams, they partner with operations teams and other business partners to understand pain points and areas of opportunity, closely track metrics to determine where to prioritize feature changes, and thrive in an ever-evolving, fast-paced landscape.

Relentlessly focus on scalability and impact - scalability of systems, versatility of configuration, and stakeholder usability
Use data to influence change and highlight problems to solve that have clear alignment with overall company goals
Work under pressure - it comes with the territory when you’re in the middle of every major strategic initiative we have

What we are looking for:

Experience driving and implementing projects from start to finish
Strong insights into how to translate business needs and HubSpot’s short and long term goals into a development roadmap for the team.
Thought leaders who can balance company priorities and system health improvements in order to build reliable, effective systems
Experience working directly with software teams and managing complex integrations
Strong communication and organizational skills to be able to work with a variety of stakeholders and leadership
Experience with data analysis. SQL/Looker experience is a plus.
You are adaptable and have demonstrated pivoting your role, strategy, or perspective based on new information or business needs
Empathy for our customers and end-users
Strong technical acumen. Do you enjoy digging into systems to understand and troubleshoot problems?
Demonstrated proficiency at navigating ambiguity

If you like solving hard problems, become energized in high-pressure situations and want to work with amazing peers - please apply and come help us make HubSpot an even more successful company.

We also actively develop and innovate new LPG powered products such as our Calor Mini-BBQ and new lightweight cylinder.

Safe and reliable energy supply
We pride ourselves on our unmatched expertise in the safe supply of butane and propane to our customers. We also offer the reassuring security of a fuel supply which doesn’t have to rely on Middle Eastern or Russian imports. 25% of our LPG is sourced from the Whitegate Refinery in Co.

Committed to sustainable energy
As befits a company who supplies one of the cleanest fossil fuels available to rural Ireland, Calor are fully committed to supporting best practice and sustainable development with regard to all environmental matters. We are constantly striving to offer a cleaner, more sustainable energy source for now and in the future.

Our journey:
Established in 1937, Calor Gas was first sold in convenient steel cylinders as an alternative energy source for those in rural Ireland.

From domestic to industrial
Calor continued to focus on the domestic market until the mid 1950’s when the industrial division was established to bring an efficient fuel source to the commercial market. In 1972 Calor and its competitor, Kosangas, merged to become Calor Kosangas. Its head office was opened on the Long Mile Road in Dublin, where Calor is still based today.

An international dimension
In 1996 Calor was acquired by SHV Energy. SHV Energy operates in 28 countries and supplies LPG to 30 million customers across 3 continents.

Our journey:
Established in 1937, Calor Gas was first sold in convenient steel cylinders as an alternative energy source for those in rural Ireland.

From domestic to industrial
Calor continued to focus on the domestic market until the mid 1950’s when the industrial division was established to bring an efficient fuel source to the commercial market. In 1972 Calor and its competitor, Kosangas, merged to become Calor Kosangas. Its head office was opened on the Long Mile Road in Dublin, where Calor is still based today.

An international dimension
In 1996 Calor was acquired by SHV Energy. SHV Energy operates in 28 countries and supplies LPG to 30 million customers across 3 continents.

We operate a global, two-sided network at scale that connects hundreds of millions of merchants and consumers. We help merchants and consumers connect, transact, and complete payments, whether they are online or in person. PayPal is more than a connection to third-party payment networks.

We enable consumers to exchange funds more safely with merchants using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal or Venmo account balance, PayPal and Venmo branded credit products, a credit card, a debit card, certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible credit card rewards. Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds and payouts. We also help merchants connect with their customers, process exchanges and returns, and manage risk. We enable consumers to engage in cross-border shopping and merchants to extend their global reach while reducing the complexity and friction involved in enabling cross-border trade.

Our beliefs are the foundation for how we conduct business every day. We live each day guided by our core values of Inclusion, Innovation, Collaboration, and Wellness.

We are looking for a technical manager who is not afraid to get hands-on and delve into the details with their team. You will lead and empower a talented team of 6+ Analytics Engineers and Data Analysts, responsible for transforming complex data into actionable intelligence.

This is a critical role where you will:

Drive Impact: Directly influence key business areas like risk assessment, product development, customer growth, and operational efficiency through data-driven insights, supporting our expansion efforts.

Insight Generation & Delivery: Partner closely with stakeholders across Product, Risk, Sales, Marketing, and Operations to understand their needs, translate them into analytical requirements, and deliver actionable insights through reports, dashboards, and deep-dive analyses.

Best Practices & Process Optimisation: Champion and implement best practices in analytics engineering, data modelling, data governance, testing, and documentation to improve data reliability and team efficiency.

Stakeholder Management & Communication: Act as a key data evangelist across the company. Clearly articulate complex findings, analytical approaches, and strategic recommendations to diverse audiences, including functional leaders (VPs) and C-level executives (CTO, CBO, CFO, etc.).

What We're Looking For: Knowledge, Skills & Experience

Experience: 6+ years of experience in data analytics, business intelligence, or analytics engineering, with at least 2+ years of proven experience managing and leading analytical teams.
